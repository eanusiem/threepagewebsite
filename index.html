    Who is Ejike Anusiem?
    </h1><br>
    <p>
    I am a Master of Health Informatics student at the University of Michigan, Graduate Student Instructor for the University of Michigan School of Information, and MPrOVE Student Intern at Michigan Medicine.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    I am usually brainstorming new iOS applications with Swift, creating dynamic web pages with CSS, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript, analyzing massive healthcare datasets with R, SQL, and Python or creating dynamic dashboards with Tableau.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    When I am not programming, I am usually watching anime or reading manga, writing a science fiction novel, acting in a short film, playing games on my Nintendo Switch, or taking pictures of the world on my iPhone XS Max. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        While I do not own a professional camera, I have taught myself certain aspects of photography such as camera angles, depth of field, light exposure, and image stabilization. All of the pictures I capture are never edited unless they need to be used for a class project.
